  <h4>SideQuest Scripting in C-Sharp</h4>

    Notice: This next section assumes you are familiar with Unity3D and C-Sharp scripting. Unity has a lot of great <a href="https://learn.unity.com/">tutorials</a> to get your started.<br><br>
  </div>
  You can build a whole range of cool things with scripting. At SideQuest Legends we thought it was important to build a scripting SDK that was as easy as
  possible to use but also had to be powerful and flexible. We decided early on that the most beneficial option was to
  allow users to use full C-Sharp scripting like you already do in Unity3D. We have created a scripting enabled SDK that allows you to run your scripts
  on our platform with a host of benefits.
