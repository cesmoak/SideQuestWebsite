      <h5>What is it?</h5>
      SideQuest is a VR content platform. We provide a suite of tools for creating and distributing VR content. We are the only 3rd party content platform available for standalone VR headsets like Oculus Quest / Go. SideQuest disrupts the VR content ecosystem by bridging the gap between cutting edge VR content and the growing VR community. 
      <br><br>
      SideQuest has become popular with developers as the easiest way to get their content to users on the latest standalone VR headsets. Building on that success the SideQuest team is also producing tools and services designed to make building VR content much easier and more cost effective.
      <br><br>
      We present our VR metaverse platform, SideQuest Legends -  A social platform for hanging out, playing games and creating content with friends. 
      <br><br>
      Included is a Unity3D integrated SDK ( SideQuest Legends SDK ) that abstracts many difficult parts involved in building engaging multi-user games and experiences. The SideQuest Legends SDK enables developers to build a single app that can run on all VR headsets as a standalone app or deployed directly to the SideQuest Legends metaverse. Our in-built networking and spatial voice service means developers can avoid heavy server costs. Full scripting support means we are the only metaverse platform that allows unrestricted capability. Developers can iterate quickly with our unified Input & Interaction system - a single set of controls that are mapped to all major VR controllers. The SideQuest Legends SDK provides the freedom to focus on the important gamification and handles most of the hard problems for you. We are excited to see what you can make!

      <!--SideQuest is a tool to make sideloading as easy as possible. Sideloading is the process of installing apps onto your-->
      <!--headset that don't come from the official store. Its a totally safe process and before SideQuest it was-->
      <!--primarily used by app developers to install apps to test them during the build. Now sideloading has become a popular-->
      <!--way for people to try out new apps from developers before they get released on the official store.<br><br>-->
      <!--SideQuest works on windows, linux and mac and includes a bunch of tools for managing your device such as a file manager, and an app manager with backup-->
      <!--support. SideQuest also includes support for 3rd party patch software for modding beat saber on Oculus Quest.<br><br>-->
