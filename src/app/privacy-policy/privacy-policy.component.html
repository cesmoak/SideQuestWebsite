      <p>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> - Deny you goods or services.</li>

        <li> - Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or
          imposing penalties.</li>

          terms that describe the program’s material aspects.</li>

        consumer request to us by emailing us at shane@sidequestvr.com
      </p>
      <p>

        behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a
        verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access of data portability twice within a 12-month period.

        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
        authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

        personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority
        to make the request.
